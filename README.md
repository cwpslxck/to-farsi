# TO-FARSI
Simple npm package to convert your english digits to farsi/arabic digits.
## Quick Start📦
Install to-farsi via npm cmds.
```bash
npm i to-farsi
```
import `to-farsi` in your file like this
```typescript
// import to-farsi like this
import toFarsiNumbers from "to-farsi";

// then use it like this
console.log(toFarsiNumbers(987654321)); // output: "۹۸۷۶۵۴۳۲۱"
```
or in your front structure use it like this:
```html
<p>{toFarsiNumbers(123456789)}</p>
```

> i don't recommend to pass farsi digital characters to your database or in your logs and just use it when you want to show the number to your users in your projects.
